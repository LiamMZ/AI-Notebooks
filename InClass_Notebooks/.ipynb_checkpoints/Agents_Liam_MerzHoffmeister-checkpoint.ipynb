    "First, let's set up some generic classes to represent `Environment`, `Agent` and `Thing`. We have a bunch of methods defined for an `Environment`, all based on what we imagine our needs might be for having an agent running around in the environment, picking things up (vacuuming, eating, holding,...) and putting them back down (a vacuum being full and spitting dirt back out, a puppy putting a bone down so it can drink water,...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 3 methods are used to set up the environment, and populate it with things, or remove things from it:\n",
    "* constructor: we feed in the dimensions of a square grid environment, and subtract 1 from each to account for the fact that Python is 0-based, but we are sending in the number of tiles in each direction. The lower-left corner of the environment is assumed to be (0,0). The environment can also have `things` and `agents` in it, so we create a list for each of those.\n",
    "* `add_thing`: we want to be able to add things to the environment. Later, we will look at creating a class to represent `Thing`s.  We need as input to this a Thing and its location (Cartesian coordinates).\n",
    "* `remove_thing`: we might need to remove some things from the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next 3 methods are useful for representing agents' **sensors**. Namely, we are concerned about whether or not the agent can sense things at or near the agent.\n",
    "* `things_near`: we might be interested to know what are all the things in the tiles *adjacent* to the agent's location (as well as at the agent's location), so we return this as a list.\n",
    "* `things_at`: perhaps we have an agent that can only sense what is going on in its location (otherwise, the same as `things_near`)\n",
    "* `percepts`: by default in this generic `Environment` class, the agents will be able to perceive anything *near* them. We can override this later depending on if we think our agent should be able to sense more or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 3 methods to represent the agent moving through a 2D rectangular grid environment, as well as executing a couple other generic **actions**.\n",
    "* `hit_wall`: we know the boundaries of the environment, so if the agent tries to move outside of them, we need to let it know that it has bumped into a wall\n",
    "* `move`: the agent tries to execute a move\n",
    "* `execute_action`: here is the meat and cheese of the agent's actuators. In this generic class, we allow the agent to move in any of the four cardinal directions, as well as pick things up (`Grab`) and set things down (`Drop`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need a few more methods to define how the actual simulation for the task environment is to proceed.\n",
    "* `is_done`: returns True if there are no more \"living\" agents to simulate\n",
    "* `step`: executes a single time step of the environment: the agent senses the environment, and then acts. This method by default is assuming a single agent, but we could override this to make it more general. You will notice that the `step` method is where we print output to the screen to stay apprised of what is going on in our virtual world.\n",
    "* `driver`: this is the driver method, which takes as an argument the number of time steps to run (default is 5).\n"

    "  * Reward cleanliness\n",
    "  * Penalize excessive moving around\n",
    "1. Implement a model-based agent\n",
    "  * Keep track of which tiles are clean/dirty\n",
    "  * Perhaps use an attribute of the agent called **model** that updates the agent's internal map of where the clean/dirty tiles all are. The entire room is initially unknown.\n",
    "  * For example, if the Roomba agent has just come from cleaning the tile at (0,0), and has now just cleaned the tile at (1,0), then the Roomba ought to know that going straight back to (0,0) is not the best option.\n",
    "  * You may want to add a **NoOp** (\"no operation\" or \"do nothing\") action choice, since moving around unnecessarily will worsen the agent's performance measure.\n",
    "1. Stochastically generate new dirt every so often\n",
    "  * Based on how long it has been since the agent last cleaned a particular tile, it may be necessary to circle back around and check the tiles again for dirt (since it may have appeared stochastically). Thus, the agent will need to track in its model *how long* it has been since it has cleaned each tile.\n",
    "  * It may be useful to print a message to the screen denoting the location of new dirt, if dirt appears somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippet could implement stochastic dirt appearance with probability `p_dirt` for each tile for each time step.  You are encouraged to modify `p_dirt` as you see fit.  The default here is a 1/10 probability of dirt appearing on any given tile at any given time step, possibly from a puppy with muddy paws or a roommate just returning from a hike.  Note that *all* tiles will need to be updated in this way, and that `p_dirt` is probably most appropriate to specify as an attribute of the environment."

    "***Okay, now we will break into groups. The following two problems are what will be graded in Moodle. This goes towards your 5% attendance and participation portion of your grade. Be creative and have fun! I will not be helping you with this. I really want to see what you all come up with on your own. I will choose a good submission and post it once you've all turned this in. (with your group's permission should I choose your group.) ***\n",

    "Let's continue to build this Roomba up! We can make things a bit more interesting by increasing the size of the room. Add the following features to your codes from **(1b)**:\n",
    "* Try a 2x2 room first.\n",
    "* In the example codes, Roomba knew the geography of the environment (i.e., that it is a 2x1 room), so it knew the options for moving around.\n",
    "  * As a first attempt for your 2x2 room, make this assumption.  Thus, the Roomba's choices of action to execute will depend on its sensed location.\n",
    "    * Note that if Roomba is at (0,0), and senses that this tile is clean, but has no information about (1,0) or (0,1), then it should choose at random where to go next. A modification of the `np.random.choice` function call above can take care of this.\n",
    "  * Once that seems to work, try to incorporate the fact that the Roomba typically does not know a priori what the shape of the room is. \n",
    "    * The easiest first step to build this into your model is to have Roomba sense its environment: if dirty, then clean the tile; if clean, then move randomly. (This is how I clean my apartment.)\n",
    "    * Then you can try building a **map** of the room as part of the Roomba's model. So as the random-movement Roomba flails around, it will sometimes bump into a wall.  But if it senses a bump, then Roomba can *learn* where the walls are, and what the available actions are depending on where in the room it is.\n",
    "    * Holy heck, we just built a *learning* model-based agent!\n",
    "* Once your Roomba is successfully tidying up a 2x1 or 2x2 room, go bigger!\n",
    "* It might be useful to note that the only thing that really needs to change is your `agent_function`, which maps percepts to actions. The `VacuumEnvironment` class is already able to handle arbitrary-sized rooms. So selecting an action will need to be modified, as well as how the agent builds its internal model of the task environment."
